\section{The Path Integral Formalism}

By the laws of quantum mechanics, the probability for a point particle that is in state $x_1$ at time $t_a$ to be found in state $x_2$ at a later time $t_b$ is
\begin{equation} \label{qmtp}
  (x_2 t_b | x_1 t_a) = \bra{x_2}\hat{U}(t_b,t_a)\ket{x_1}
\end{equation}
